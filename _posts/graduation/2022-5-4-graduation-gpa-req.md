The universityâ€™s GPA graduation requirement is **3.0**.  If the student has below a 3.0, they will not be able to graduate.

Note: It is your responsibility to check the [recommended dates for graduation](https://semo.edu/student-support/academic-support/registrar/graduation/index.html#studentrecords).
