Let’s face it. When it comes to part-time job opportunities, we know you have
options in the Cape Girardeau area. However, working on campus can connect you with a large network of faculty, staff, and students who are interested in your academic success and will put your student needs before their work needs. You may even be able to find a part-time job within your area of study to gain
professional experience.

To be eligible to participate in the student employment programs at Southeast,
students must be enrolled in a degree-seeking program and enrolled in a minimum number of hours&nbsp;(U.S. citizens – 6 hours, international undergraduates – 12 hours, international graduates – 9 hours, international graduate assistants – 6 hours).&nbsp;All student workers are limited to working a <strong> maximum of 20 hours per week </strong>. 

During summer and breaks, students may be eligible for additional hours, based on the approval of their supervisor. &nbsp;

High school, provisionally admitted students, Cape College Center students,
and students enrolled in the&nbsp;intensive English&nbsp;program are not eligible to work on campus. &nbsp;

The&nbsp;Office of Career Services posts available student worker positions on  REDHAWKjobs.com
