<h3>Fund your education while gaining valuable professional experience.</h3>

The primary purpose of our&nbsp;graduate&nbsp;assistantships provide
opportunities to gain professional experience, academic training, and to help relieve some of the financial&nbsp;burden&nbsp;of&nbsp;graduate&nbsp;school.&nbsp;&nbsp;

Assistantships are offered in both academic and administrative roles.&nbsp;
Responsibilities&nbsp;and eligibility&nbsp;for assistantships may vary among
departments.&nbsp;

Graduate assistantships pay a stipend of $8,860 for the academic year and
cover the tuition for up to 9 credits of graduate level coursework in both the fall and spring semesters and up to 6 credits during the summer semester.
