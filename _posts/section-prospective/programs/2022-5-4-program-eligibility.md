2. An undergradate GPA of 3.0 on a 4.0 scale. 
3. Completed at least 6 hours of science and 6 hours of mathematics in undergraduate degree 

# Prereq: Non-CS majors 
Students from Non-Computer Science major need to take one or both the pre-requisite courses:
1. CS500: Fundamentals of Programming.

- Object Oriented Programming
- Discrete Mathematics
- Standard libraries with an emphasis on practical programming
2. CS503: Fundamentals of Computing.
- Computer Organization/Architecture
- Computer Networks
- Algorithms Design & Analysis
- Operating Systems
CS500 and CS503 does not count towards your degree. You are required to complete them before you can start your regular (core/optional) courses.

# Can you waive off my prerequisites courses?
A student can take the prerequisite exams in order to get the prerequisites waived (see below). Please note that the waiver is at the discretion of graduate coordinator/department chair. 

# Options for prerequisite course waiver (any ONE):
