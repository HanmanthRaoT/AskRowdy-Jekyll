#### **Request for 4 courses in 1st semester**

CS dept **does not** recommend **12-credit hour (or 4 courses)** course load in the 1st semester, UNLESS there is an extraordinary circumstance. 

This is done only on a *student-by-student basis* after the completion of 1st year, and you will need special approval from your advisor.
