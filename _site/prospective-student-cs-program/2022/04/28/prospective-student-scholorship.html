<p>Scholarships are a form of aid that doesn’t require repayment. They’re awarded based on a variety of factors including academic achievement, talent, athletic ability, leadership, participation in a specific campus activity, geography, or financial need.</p>

<p>These Scholarships reflect our investment in your potential.</p>

<p>When you apply to Southeast, we automatically review your application for most of our scholarships and award academic scholarships at the time of admission. Additionally, there are a few things to know:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Test scores can be combined for scholarship purposes.</strong> Did you take the ACT or SAT more than once? We’ll combine your best ACT or SAT subscores to make a superscore.</li>
  <li><strong>Test scores are not required for scholarships.</strong> You’ve earned great grades, but test taking makes your palms sweat. With a 3.25 high school GPA, you qualify for Copper Dome - no test required.</li>
  <li><strong>Many scholarships are “stackable”.</strong> Many scholarships can be stacked and added together for a larger award. Plus, your need-based aid won’t reduce your scholarship value.</li>
  <li><strong>Scholarships are designed for simple renewal.</strong> Take the appropriate number of credit hours in a year and maintain a select GPA and the renewal process is quick and easy.</li>
</ul>
